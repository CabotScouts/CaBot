# CaBot - the Cabot Explorers Discord Bot
CaBot is a Discord bot, running on the [Cabot Explorers](https://cabotexplorers.org.uk) Discord server originally setup to allow our Explorers to stay in touch during the UK's Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.

The bot provides various functions to assist with the running of the server, such as helping verify Explorers when they join the server for the first time, logging messages that are sent, as well as adding a points system.

The original bot was thrown together in JavaScript ([final commit of that version](https://github.com/CabotExplorers/CaBot/tree/50fa4122471f9e367502949de6c48c560bf28656)), before being rebuilt in Python for longevity.
